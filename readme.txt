Admin bar floating on the top. Hide admin bar or set its opacity.

== Description ==

Admin bar moves your website 32px down by default, but now it doesn't. This plugin was developed, because sometimes when you're using absolute positions, admin bar causes problems with top positioning.

	<li>set opacity of admin bar on hover</li>
	<li>set auto-hide and show on hover</li>
</ul>
